These demos were mostly made during development of the library, with the purpose of testing things as they were made.
By no means are these demos a fully encompassing overview of the library. Make sure to check out the doxygen documentation.

The 300 leds tests demo in particular can be very useful to make sure your hardware is up to speed for what you want to use it for.
The 'colour test' demo can also be very useful, as it allowes you to fairly easily see what certain colour values will end up looking like.
